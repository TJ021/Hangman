Instructions:
Choose a category and a word wil randomly be choosen.
Once a word is choosen, guess a letter contained inside the word or guess the word itself.
If your guess is not a letter, and isn't the same length as the amount of dashes, it will count as a wrong guess and you will be penalized.
If you guess the word correctly, you win the game.
If you get 6 incorrect guesses, you lose the game.
Good luck!
